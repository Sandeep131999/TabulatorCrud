Formatting Data: 
Formatters allow you to format the data in a cell to a specific format,
such as applying currency formatting, date formatting, or custom formatting rules.
This ensures that the data is displayed in a visually appealing and meaningful way to the user.

Adding Custom Content: 
Formatters enable you to add custom content to the cell, 
such as buttons, icons, or HTML elements. This allows you
to enhance the visual presentation of the data and provide interactive elements for the user.

Conditional Formatting: 
Formatters can be used to apply conditional formatting based on the cell's value.
For example, you can change the cell's background color, font color, or apply specific styles based 
on certain conditions, making it easier for users to spot important information or visualize data trends.

Data Transformation: 
Formatters provide a way to transform the raw data before displaying it. 
This can include calculations, data manipulation, or combining multiple 
data fields into a single cell. It allows you to present the data in a 
more meaningful and understandable way to the user.

Localization and Internationalization: 
Formatters can be used to handle localization and internationalization requirements, 
such as translatingtext, displaying numbers or dates in the appropriate format for
different locales, or adapting the content based on the user's language preferences.
